# krg.scratch — per-lab /scratch on a plain ZFS dataset, with automatic NFS overflow.
#
# WHAT: each lab (project) gets ONE /scratch/<lab> directory that is a plain ZFS
# mount (NOT a FUSE layer). On waiter that dataset lives on `scratchpool` — striped
# HDD for capacity, fronted by an NVMe metadata (special) vdev + NVMe L2ARC, so ZFS
# serves hot reads from RAM/NVMe and keeps the bytes on the (large) HDD. There is no
# tiering daemon in the read path; the kernel ZFS ARC/L2ARC handles hot/cold.
#
# WHY NOT autotier (the previous design): autotier was a 45Drives FUSE filesystem
# that moved files NVMe->HDD->NFS by access frequency. It wrote a RocksDB record on
# every file open/close and ABORTED under concurrent small-file training reads (a
# multi-worker dataloader), taking /scratch down with it. It is unmaintained (last
# release Dec 2021) and unfixable by config. See docs/scratch-greenfield.md and the
# disko-config.nix "WHY THIS LAYOUT" block. The whole FUSE failure class is gone now.
#
# CAPACITY OVERFLOW (the only mover, and it's OUT of the read hot path): when the
# pool fills past a high-water mark, the per-lab `overflow` job (scratch-overflow,
# a daily systemd timer) demotes the least-recently-accessed files to a cold NFS
# area on fabricant and replaces each with a SYMLINK to the NFS copy — so the path
# still works (reads just go over the network) and `scratch-restore` pulls a file
# back to fast storage on demand. It is FAIL-CLOSED: a local file is unlinked only
# after its NFS copy is fully written, fsynced, and verified (size + sha256); if the
# cold mount is down the unit won't even start (RequiresMountsFor). This is the
# automatic, recoverable, no-policing capacity backstop the design calls for.
#
# LAB ISOLATION (krg and e4e are INDEPENDENT labs sharing this box): each lab's
# /scratch tree is chmod 2770, group = that lab's AD group (krg -> "Kastner Research
# Group"), so one lab can't read another's data on shared hardware. Because this is
# a plain ZFS mount (no FUSE create-impersonation quirk), it's a real 2770 — no o+x
# hack is needed (that was an autotier-only workaround). With `perUser.enable`, each
# lab member also gets a private <mountPoint>/<user> auto-created on login (a
# pam_exec session hook), guarded on the mount being active (fail-closed, same as
# the modules/nfs-home.nix /home gate).
#
# IMPERMANENCE: the scratch dataset is on its own pool (scratchpool, off
# nvmepool/root), so it survives the boot rollback untouched. The overflow job keeps
# its manifest ON the scratch dataset (durable, travels with the data) and the
# symlinks themselves are the source of truth for restore — nothing here needs a
# /persist bind.
