# krg.localCache — node-local fast per-user cache at /local/<user>.
#
# WHAT: a plain, durable, NODE-local ZFS dataset (no FUSE, no NFS, no tiering)
# that holds the regenerable, hot, small-file, per-host state that has no business
# sitting on the NFS /home (modules/nfs-home.nix). Two kinds move here:
#   1. IDE remote servers — ~/.vscode-server, ~/.cursor-server — via a SYMLINK
#      created on login (the server tree is per-host and pure cache: delete it and
#      VS Code/Cursor re-download on next connect).
#   2. The cache class — XDG_CACHE_HOME (~/.cache: pip, matplotlib, …), Hugging
#      Face / torch model caches, the conda PACKAGE cache, npm — via per-session
#      env vars pointed under /local/<user>. Only CACHES move; conda ENVS and real
#      data stay in the user's home.
#
# WHY not /home (NFS): the IDE servers and these caches are hot, watch-heavy,
# many-small-file workloads — exactly what NFS is worst at (latency per stat/open,
# and inotify doesn't propagate over NFS so file watchers fall back to polling).
# They're also regenerable, so they don't deserve durable, network-served home
# space. WHY not /scratch (krg.scratch): that namespace DEMOTES cold files onto NFS
# when the pool fills (and reads of demoted files then go over the network) — the
# opposite of what a dev cache wants. This module is the deliberately boring
# counterpart: one local NVMe dataset, fastest path, no network dependency, never
# overflows.
#
# WAITER TOPOLOGY (the only consumer today): nvmepool/local -> /local (legacy mount,
# disko-config.nix). It is OFF the @blank rollback (its own dataset, like
# /var/lib/docker), so caches survive reboots and aren't re-downloaded — and for the
# same reason it needs NO entry in modules/impermanence.nix's /persist bind list.
#
# PER-USER DIR + SYMLINKS: a pam_exec session hook (the same pattern as
# krg.scratch.perUser and pam_mkhomedir) creates /local/<user> (mode 0700) on login,
# then symlinks each `symlinks` name from the user's home into it. GUARDED: only while
# /local is actually mounted (never seed onto a bare mountpoint), and a symlink is
# created ONLY if the home path doesn't already exist — so an existing real
# ~/.vscode-server is never clobbered (such a user opts in once with `rm -rf
# ~/.vscode-server`, then the next login creates the symlink). Non-blocking: a failure
# here never denies login.
#
# CACHE ENV VARS: set via environment.shellInit (cross-shell: bash + zsh), computed
# with `id -un` at shell start (robust where $USER expansion in sessionVariables is
# not), and only exported when /local/<user> exists — so a host/user without this
# cache (or with /local unmounted) just keeps the home defaults.

  # Two guards, both load-bearing:

  #     <mountPoint> dir, so `[ -d ]` is true even when the dataset FAILED to mount —
  #     which would point caches at the ephemeral root. We require the real mount, the
  #     same check the pam hook uses.
  #   - `[ -d "$__krg_lc" ]`: only redirect if the per-user dir exists. It is created by
  #     the pam hook (running as root, the only one that can write under the 0755
  #     root-owned <mountPoint>); the unprivileged shell can't mkdir it, so without this
  #     the exported XDG_CACHE_HOME etc. would point at a dir the user can't create.
