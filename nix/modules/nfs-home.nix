# /home from NFS — give AD users a home that lives OFF the host's local disk.
#
# WHY: SSSD's fallback_homedir=/home/%u + pam_mkhomedir (modules/sssd-ad-client.nix)
# create a home on first login. If /home sits on the local ZFS root, an impermanent
# host (krg.impermanence) would wipe every home on each boot. Mounting /home from NFS
# moves homes off the root, the prerequisite for impermanence. uid/gid are deterministic
# across the fleet (AD algorithmic ID mapping), so a plain sec=sys NFSv4 mount lines up
# without idmapd translation (the client uses numeric ids for AUTH_SYS by default;
# if owners ever show as `nobody`, set the idmapd Domain to krg.local on both ends).
#
# SERVER: fabricant exports this via the ansible nfs_server role (rpool/nfs/home ->
# /srv/nfs/home over NFSv4, no_root_squash so the client's pam_mkhomedir can create
# and chown each user's home).
#
# GOTCHA — local accounts under /home. This mount SHADOWS whatever already sits at
# the mountpoint. The break-glass admin must NOT keep its home here (users/admin.nix
# pins it to /var/lib/<account>), or it would depend on the NFS server being up —
# defeating the point of a break-glass account. (That same off-/home home is also what
# lets the login gate below keep the admin usable when the NFS server is down.)

  # reboot would erase (silent data loss). Users with homes elsewhere (break-glass admin
  # in /var/lib/<account>) match nothing here, so they log in normally and the host stays
  # recoverable while NFS is down. With the `stdout` pam_exec flag, the message reaches
  # the user being denied.
