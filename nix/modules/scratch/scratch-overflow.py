"""scratch-overflow — demote the coldest /scratch files to NFS to relieve capacity.

Greenfield scratch design (docs/scratch-greenfield.md): /scratch lives on a striped
HDD pool fronted by NVMe ARC/L2ARC, so ZFS handles hot/cold for READS by itself.
This job handles CAPACITY only: when the pool fills past --high percent, it moves the
least-recently-accessed files to a cold NFS area, replacing each local file with a
symlink to its NFS copy (the path keeps working, reads just go over the network),
until the pool drops below --low percent. A self-service `scratch-restore` pulls a
file back to fast local storage.

FAIL-CLOSED BY CONSTRUCTION — this is the whole point of writing it carefully:
a local file is only ever unlinked AFTER its NFS copy is fully written, fsynced,
and verified (size + full sha256). If the cold area is not mounted, or any copy/
verify step fails, the local file is left exactly as it was. We never trust a
half-written cold copy. Run as root (the NFS export is no_root_squash) so the cold
copy preserves each file's owner/group/mode.

The krg.scratch overflow systemd timer invokes this; it is safe to run by hand,
and --dry-run reports what it WOULD move without touching anything.
