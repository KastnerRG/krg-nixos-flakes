# krg.firewall — the single switch for the in-guest OS firewall (nftables).
#
# Fleet-wide policy (set in profiles/base.nix, expressible per-host):
#   * NO PORT IS GLOBALLY OPEN BY DEFAULT. The strict default for SSH is
#     ucsd + ops (via krg.base.serviceHost); compute hosts opt OUT for
#     wider reach. The fleet US-floor / attacker-eviction policy is
#     enforced behind the firewall by the CrowdSec stack
#     (services.crowdsec + services.crowdsec-firewall-bouncer +
#     services.geoipupdate). See nix/modules/security/crowdsec.nix.
#
#   * The four operator-facing port lists, from most-restrictive to least:
#
#     sourcedPorts      — explicit per-port source restriction (operator picks
#                         the CIDRs). Use for internal-only protocols where
#                         even US is too loose — e.g. OpenBao 8200 sealab-only
#                         on krg-vault, AD ports sealab-only on krg-ldap.
#     sshSources        — SSH-specific (port 22) tightening for service hosts.
#                         Mirrors the Proxmox perimeter (ucsd + ops nets).
#     allowedTCPPorts   — "reachable per the host's policy". With CrowdSec on
#                         (the fleet default), the in-guest firewall opens
#                         these ports globally — CrowdSec's bouncer drops
#                         attackers behind them via a separate nftables table
#                         (decisions live in a small dynamic ban set, not a
#                         giant pre-loaded allowlist).
#     publicPorts       — EXPLICIT opt-IN-to-globally-public. The escape
#                         hatch for protocols where source restriction
#                         breaks legitimate clients (ACME HTTP-01 from
#                         Let's Encrypt's multi-perspective validators —
#                         see krg-vault). Each entry SHOULD have an inline
#                         `# reason:` comment for review.
#
#     Functionally, `allowedTCPPorts` and `publicPorts` both land in
#     networking.firewall.allowedTCPPorts today — CrowdSec is the layer
#     that distinguishes them at runtime via its decision set. They're kept
#     distinct in the option surface so the operator's intent is explicit
#     (publicPorts requires a reason; allowedTCPPorts inherits the fleet
#     CrowdSec policy by default).
#
#   * The four lists are intersected with disjointness assertions (see
#     `config.assertions` below) so operator can't silently put a port in
#     two contradictory lists (closes #83). If you put port N in:
#       allowedTCPPorts AND publicPorts → assertion fires (opposite intent)
#       allowedTCPPorts AND sourcedPorts → assertion fires (sourcedPorts
#                                          wins; listing in both is redundant)
#       publicPorts AND sourcedPorts → assertion fires (opposite intent)
#
#   * Service hosts (krg.base.serviceHost = true) automatically get
#     sshSources populated from trusted.json's ucsd + ops nets, so 22 is
#     already tighter than the fleet CrowdSec policy there. The disjointness
#     handling excludes sshSources-covered 22 from the globally-open list
#     (the stricter rule wins).
#
# Cross-references:
#   * CrowdSec module: nix/modules/security/crowdsec.nix
#     (acquisitions, scenarios, parser whitelist for trusted IPSets).
#   * GeoIP data source: services.geoipupdate (writes
#     /var/lib/GeoIP/GeoLite2-Country.mmdb; CrowdSec's geoip-enrich parser
#     reads from there).
#   * Trusted IPSets: nix/networks/trusted.json (shared with the Ansible
#     proxmox_firewall layer; consumed by the CrowdSec whitelist).

        Ports the host wants reachable. Land in
        `networking.firewall.allowedTCPPorts` (globally open at the
        nftables INPUT layer). With the fleet CrowdSec stack enabled
        (the default per `profiles/base.nix`), the
        crowdsec-firewall-bouncer's separate `crowdsec`/`crowdsec6`
        nftables tables drop traffic from IPs that CrowdSec has banned
        (community CAPI decisions + locally-triggered scenarios like
        ssh-bf). The bouncer drops by SOURCE IP regardless of which
        port is reached, so this filter applies to every port we open
        — `publicPorts` doesn't bypass it either.

        `publicPorts` is functionally identical at the nftables layer;
        the only difference is intent + grep-ability (publicPorts
        documents an exception with a required reason comment). Use
        `publicPorts` for ports where an operator has thought through
        the trade-off (today: ACME HTTP-01 challenge from anywhere);
        use `allowedTCPPorts` for the host's normal services.

        Interaction with the other port lists:
          * `sshSources` (22 on service hosts) silently moves 22 out of
            the globally-open list. No assertion fires for an overlap
            here — it's the expected configuration on service hosts.
          * `sourcedPorts` (operator-explicit per-port restriction) wins
            over the globally-open default. Listing a port in BOTH is
            REDUNDANT — a per-PR assertion (`allowedTCPPorts ∩
            sourcedPorts`) flags the duplicate so the operator drops one.
          * `publicPorts` is an "intent signal" overlap. A per-PR
            assertion fires when a port is in both; pick one.

        Default empty so a host that adds this module without explicit
        configuration gets the minimal attack surface (no in-guest ports
        beyond what `monitoringPorts`/`sshSources` open).
