# krg.crowdsec — fleet-wide CrowdSec Security Engine.
#
# Thin wrapper over upstream services.crowdsec. Implements the fleet
# "no public access — US is the floor" policy (issue #74) reactively:
# CrowdSec reads sshd (and traefik on server hosts) logs from
# journalctl, evaluates community scenarios + a local trusted-net
# whitelist + geo enrichment, and emits DECISIONS (4h IP bans by
# default) that the firewall bouncer picks up and drops at nftables.
#
# WHY THIS REPLACES THE STATIC GEOIP SET (closed PR #90):
#   Pre-loading 163K v4 + 254K v6 MaxMind US CIDRs into a single
#   nftables transaction hit netlink ENOBUFS regardless of chunking
#   strategy (named sets, anonymous inline sets, chunked add-element
#   commands all failed). CrowdSec sidesteps the problem entirely:
#   decisions live in a small DYNAMIC ban set populated only by IPs
#   that have actually misbehaved (community-flagged or scenario-
#   tripping locally). The mmdb lookup happens at scenario evaluation
#   time per-event (microseconds) rather than at firewall-load time.
#
# COVERAGE:
#   * crowdsecurity/linux + crowdsecurity/sshd hub collections:
#     ssh-bf (brute-force), ssh-slow-bf, ssh-cve scenarios — the
#     fail2ban replacement. CrowdSec's ssh-bf has lower FPR than
#     fail2ban's jail.d/sshd because it correlates events across
#     parsers rather than just grep-matching auth.log.
#   * crowdsecurity/geoip-enrich parser: tags each event with the
#     source IP's ISO country code (from /var/lib/GeoIP/, populated by
#     krg.geoipupdate). Scenarios that care about country can branch on
#     `evt.Enriched.IsoCode`.
#   * Community blocklists (CrowdSec CAPI): activated by wiring
#     `capi.credentialsFile` (see config block below). The setup
#     script auto-registers each host with api.crowdsec.net on first
#     activation; from then on, the LAPI pulls the global community
#     decision feed (~30K-50K malicious IPs at any moment, refreshed
#     continuously by the worldwide CrowdSec fleet). This is the
#     practical "US floor" — commodity scanners hit thousands of
#     CrowdSec users in parallel, so attacker IPs land in CAPI
#     within minutes of first attack and into our bouncer's drop
#     set on the next 10s poll, usually BEFORE they ever try us.
#   * Local whitelist: ucsd + sealab + ops CIDRs from trusted.json never
#     trigger bans. ops is the manual-override slot for traveling staff
#     (see docs/working-remotely.md).
#
# ARCHITECTURAL SHIFT FROM PR #90:
#   PR #90 dropped non-US packets on first arrival. CrowdSec lets the
#   first packet through (a fraction of a second), bans the IP after
#   it trips ANY scenario or matches community CTI. In practice this is
#   STRICTER posture (caught attackers stay banned fleet-wide for 4h;
#   community-shared decisions cover IPs we've never seen), but the
#   failure shape is different — a brand-new well-behaved foreign
#   scanner might land one connection before getting banned. The original
#   docstring called this "attack surface noise reduction"; CrowdSec
#   delivers that goal more effectively than the static set could have.
#
# DEPENDENCIES:
#   * krg.geoipupdate.enable = true (provides the mmdb).
#   * krg.crowdsecBouncer.enable = true (applies decisions to nftables).
#   * trusted.json (read directly here for the local whitelist — no
#     option duplication; same source as krg.firewall.sshSources).
