# Shared AD-group → local-group bridge.
#
# SSSD algorithmic ID mapping derives an AD group's GID from its SID, so an AD group
# can never BE a fixed/local group (cuda's device GID, docker's daemon group, …).
# This module instead re-derives a LOCAL group's membership from one or more named
# AD groups: for each entry `krg.adGroupSync.<name>`, a oneshot `<name>-group-sync`
# (+ a 10-min timer) runs getent → gpasswd -M, UNIONing the resolved AD members with
# the group's locally-declared members.
#
# WHY A TIMER (not a one-shot at switch): the synced members are NOT durable — every
# nixos-rebuild regenerates /etc/group with only the DECLARED members, and on
# impermanence hosts the root is rolled back each boot — so the timer re-applies them.
#
# Consumers wire their own semantic options into this rather than hand-rolling the
# unit: modules/hardware/nvidia.nix (krg.nvidia.cudaAccessGroups → GPU device group)
# and modules/docker.nix (krg.docker.accessGroups → the Docker daemon group).
