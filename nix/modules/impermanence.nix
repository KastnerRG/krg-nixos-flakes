# Impermanence ("erase your darlings") for ZFS root.
#
# Every boot, nvmepool/root is rolled back to its empty @blank snapshot (taken at
# install, see disko-config.nix), so `/` starts pristine. Anything that must
# survive a reboot has to be either (a) reproducible from the flake (NixOS
# regenerates it), (b) on a non-rolled-back dataset (/nix, /persist, /tools), or
# (c) listed below to be bind-mounted from /persist into the live root.
#
# GOTCHA — if it isn't reproducible and isn't listed here, IT IS GONE on reboot.
# That's the whole point, but it bites: SSH host keys, machine-id, the AD keytab,
# Docker images, fail2ban's ban DB, monitoring data all live in mutable state and
# would silently reset. The list below is curated for THIS host (server + Docker +
# AD client); add to it when you add stateful services.
