        Service host (vs compute): restrict in-guest SSH to the trusted UCSD nets

        strict SSH (ucsd + ops only). Compute hosts (waiter et al.) opt OUT

        On compute hosts, what catches attackers behind the globally-open
        SSH port is the fleet CrowdSec stack:
          * Community blocklists (CAPI): ~30K-50K continuously-updated
            known-malicious IPs pushed to the bouncer's drop set.
            Commodity scanners pre-banned before they ever try us.
          * Local `ssh-bf` scenario (crowdsecurity/sshd): bans an IP
            for 4h after ~10 failed SSH auths in 10 min, catching the
            gap between first attack and CAPI propagation.
          * Whitelist: ucsd + sealab + ops + machines never raise alerts.
        Geoip enrichment tags every event with country (`evt.Enriched.IsoCode`),
        but THIS PR does NOT add a country-based ban scenario — geoip is
        signal-only here, available for future scenarios. See
