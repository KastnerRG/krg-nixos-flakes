  # roles/krg_admin), so the SAME break-glass password works on every host,

  # without a console password NOBODY can log in at the physical console when
  # SSH / network / AD is down — exactly when the break-glass admin is the only
  # way in. A hash in the repo is offline-crackable, so use a STRONG passphrase.
