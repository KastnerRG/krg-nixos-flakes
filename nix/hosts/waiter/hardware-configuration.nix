# waiter — hardware bits ONLY. Everything storage-related is owned elsewhere:
#   - partitions / pools / datasets / fileSystems  -> disko-config.nix (disko
#     generates config.fileSystems for /, /nix, /persist, /tools and the four
#     mirrored ESP mounts /boot, /boot-1, /boot-2, /boot-3)
#   - ZFS knobs (devNodes, supportedFilesystems, hostId-consuming bits) -> modules/zfs.nix
#   - rollback + persistence                       -> modules/impermanence.nix
#
# GOTCHA — regenerating this file. When you run
#   nixos-generate-config --show-hardware-config
# on the real waiter, copy in ONLY the hardware lines (boot.initrd.*KernelModules,
# microcode, max-jobs). Do NOT paste the `fileSystems.*`, `swapDevices`, or
# `boot.loader.*` it emits: disko already declares the filesystems, swap is zram
# (see hosts/waiter/default.nix), and the bootloader is set below. Pasting them
# produces duplicate-definition conflicts.

  # partitions (disko-config.nix) and GRUB is installed to every one.

  # NVRAM boot entries — which is also why canTouchEfiVariables must be false.
  # GRUB only ever reads the vfat /boot, never the ZFS pool, so there's no
  # zpool-feature-flag fragility and we deliberately don't set grub.zfsSupport.
