  # in initrd every boot; durable state is bind-mounted back from /persist
  # (modules/impermanence.nix). Enabling this also flips the host to systemd initrd
  # (the rollback runs as a stage-1 unit). VALIDATED on-box across two reboots 2026-05-21.
  #
  # Two fixes had to land before this was safe (both now in tree):
  #  - /home is on NFS and the mount is NON-BLOCKING (krg.nfsHome below — plain nofail,
  #    NOT x-systemd.automount, which wedged early boot). This moves user homes OFF the
  #    rolled-back root so they aren't wiped each boot.
  #  - the rolled-back root is empty, and systemd 258's PID1 FREEZES on an empty /usr
  #    ("Refusing to run ... /usr/ is not populated"); modules/impermanence.nix reseeds
  #    /usr/bin/env in initrd before switch-root so it boots (see that module + the
  #    disko-config.nix @blank note).
  #
  # GOTCHA when (re)enabling on a running or freshly-installed host: migrate live state
  # into /persist BEFORE the first rollback (keytab, ssh host keys, /etc/machine-id,
  # /var/lib/{nixos,sss,krg}; break-glass admin home /var/lib/<account> is in the list),
  # or the first boot wipes it. Deploy with `nixos-rebuild boot` (NOT switch — switch
  # fails on persist-files "file already exists"). /nix, /persist, /tools and
  # /var/lib/docker are separate datasets, off the rolled-back root.

  # AD user homes come from NFS (fabricant: rpool/nfs/home -> /srv/nfs/home). This

  # Break-glass krg-admin is unaffected: its home is /var/lib/krg-admin (users/admin.nix),
  # which impermanence persists (modules/impermanence.nix). Server pinned by IP so /home
  # never waits on DNS. The mount is a PLAIN nofail NFS mount (NOT an automount — autofs
  # wedged early boot; see modules/nfs-home.nix), ordered after the network: the box
  # always boots, and if fabricant is down at boot /home is simply left UNMOUNTED (it
  # does NOT mount on later access — a remount or reboot is needed once the server is back).
  #
  # KNOWN TRADE-OFF (impermanence + nofail /home): if /home is unmounted at login time,
  # pam_mkhomedir (krg.adClient) creates an ephemeral home on the rolled-back root that
  # is WIPED on the next reboot — a data-loss window absent from the old persistent root.
  # fabricant being down at boot is already a major incident (it also hosts the AD DC, so

  # to close that window is a tracked follow-up (see CLAUDE.md pending items).

  # LAB ISOLATION: krg and e4e are INDEPENDENT labs sharing this box, so /scratch/krg is

  # the old autotier o+x hack is gone). The "Kastner Research Group" group already
  # exists in Samba AD (it backed the prior deploy), so the perms step applies 2770
  # as soon as SSSD resolves it after the domain re-join; it stays tolerant
  # (/scratch/krg root-owned/admin-only) if the group can't yet resolve, so /scratch
  # always comes up — then tightens on the next start.

  # E4E IS NOT WIRED: no e4e users/machines yet, so scratchpool/scratch-e4e stays

  #
  # OVERFLOW (capacity backstop, NOT in the read path): fabricant exports
  # rpool/nfs/scratch-krg with no_root_squash (ansible nfs_server), mounted here at
  # /srv/scratch-cold/krg. When scratchpool fills past the high-water mark, the daily
  # scratch-overflow timer demotes the least-recently-accessed files there and leaves a
  # symlink (reads still work over NFS); `scratch-restore` pulls a file back. FAIL-CLOSED:
  # if the cold mount is down the unit won't start (RequiresMountsFor) and a local file is
