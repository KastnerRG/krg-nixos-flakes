# Campus-mandated endpoint security agents: Qualys Cloud Agent (vulnerability
# management) and Trellix Endpoint Security HX / xagt (EDR + anti-malware).
#
# These are proprietary Ubuntu/CentOS .deb/.rpm binaries with no nixpkgs
# package. They are NOT installed via the vendor installer (which uses
# dpkg/yum/systemctl and won't work on NixOS). Instead we:
#   1. run them under nix-ld — both binaries use the standard
#      /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 interpreter and only need glibc +
#      libstdc++/libgcc_s from the system; the rest of their libraries are
#      bundled and resolved via RPATH (/opt/fireeye/lib, /usr/local/qualys/...);
#   2. extract the .deb payloads to their expected FHS paths and enroll them
#      once, via the oec-install one-shot service (after network-online);
#   3. run the daemons with the vendor's own unit semantics.
#
# The installer archive is referenced by a RUNTIME path (not a Nix store path)
# so the credentials it contains never land in the world-readable Nix store.
# Place it out-of-band at krg.oecQualysTrellix.installerArchive (default
# /var/lib/krg/oec/oec-qualystrellixinstallers-linux.tgz).
