# Why hashicorp/vault and not an openbao provider?
#
# OpenBao is a community fork of HashiCorp Vault and deliberately maintains
# full API compatibility — same endpoints, same token format, same secret
# engine APIs. The OpenBao project considered publishing a dedicated
# Terraform/OpenTofu provider but decided against it while the APIs remain
# identical (see https://github.com/openbao/openbao/issues/339 and
# https://github.com/orgs/openbao/discussions/637). Their official guidance
# is to use hashicorp/vault. The provider has no idea whether it is talking
# to Vault or OpenBao — it just speaks the API.
#
# Run from krg-deploy. Before applying, export:
#   export VAULT_ADDR="http://krg-vault.ucsd.edu:8200"
#   export VAULT_TOKEN="<root or admin token>"
